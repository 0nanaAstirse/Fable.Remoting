In this article, we will explain what SIDCHG is, how it works, and where to download it.
 
## What is SIDCHG?
 
SIDCHG is a command-line utility that can modify the SID and the computer name of a local computer. A SID is a unique identifier that Windows assigns to each user account and security group. The computer name is the name that identifies the computer on a network.

Changing the SID and the computer name can be necessary when cloning or migrating Windows systems, or when restoring a system from a backup. This is because having duplicate SIDs or computer names on a network can cause conflicts and errors.
 
SIDCHG can also change other identifiers that are related to the SID, such as:
 
- The WSUS ID for Windows updates
- The Device Identifier for modern Windows apps
- The Machine GUID and Machine ID
- The MSDTC CID for distributed transactions
- The Dhcpv6 DUID for IPv6 addresses
- The SQL Server master database
- The encryption state to preserve encrypted files
- The OneDrive settings
- The McAfee ID

SIDCHG can also preserve credentials stored in Windows Vault, certificates, and other encrypted stored information.
 
## How does SIDCHG work?
 
SIDCHG works by replacing the current computer SID with a new random SID. It also changes the computer name according to the user's input. It then modifies all the other identifiers that are related to the SID, such as the ones listed above.
 
SIDCHG can be run from a command prompt or a batch file. It has various options and parameters that allow the user to customize the operation. For example, the user can specify the new SID value, the new computer name, the drives to check for SID changes, whether to reboot or shutdown after the operation, whether to reset OneDrive, and more.
 
SIDCHG also has options to revert or repeat a previous SID change, in case something goes wrong or not all changes are applied. It also has options to remove traces of SIDCHG from the registry, or to store or remove the license key.
 
## Where can I download SIDCHG?
 
SIDCHG can be downloaded from various web sites that offer software updates or downloads. One of them is Stratesave[^1^], which is the official site of SIDCHG. Another one is Nsane Forums[^3^], which is a community site for software enthusiasts. A third one is Docker[^4^], which is a platform for containerized applications.
 
Before downloading SIDCHG, make sure that you have a valid license key for it. You can purchase a license key from Stratesave[^1^] or contact them for more information. You can also try to find a free license key from other sources, but be careful of malware or scams.
 
After downloading SIDCHG, you can run it from a command prompt or a batch file. Make sure that you read the documentation and understand the options and parameters before using it. Also, make sure that you backup your system and data before changing your SID or computer name.
