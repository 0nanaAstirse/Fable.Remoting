# Credits

Special thanks to [Alfonso Garcia-Caro](https://github.com/alfonsogarciacaro), the auther himself of the Fable compiler for his awesome work on Fable and for being open and for helping me add reflection features to Fable which make the implementation of the library possible in the first place on the client.  

Many many thanks to [Diego Esmerio](https://github.com/Nhowka) for his work on implementing a uniform API for the library across the server and the client and other features like multi-argument type definitions, among others.
